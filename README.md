## ❇️ What is Hacktoberfest and how do I get started?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source, organised by Digital Ocean. ([More details here](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/))

If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at these resources:

- [Firstcontributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
- [Digitalocean's guide to creating your first pull request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkuYH40cjo4)

These two resources have everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR. Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

## ❇️ Rules

- Nothing much to change, just make your own logical dataset
- The template code is in python, but you are free to alter the entire code to some other language of your choice (‾◡◝)
- Please make sure that you describe about the dataset you created

## ❇️ How to contribute

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.

3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates).

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/GDSC-SJEC/Neural-Network-Simulation.git`
   - `git pull upstream main`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Create a branch.

5. In the Submissions directory (folder), create a directory named after yourself. (Eg: PravinKumar/).

6. Within this folder you just made, create .py file with the template code given and update your dataset and run the code.

7. Also include a .txt file describing what is your understanding by running this code.

10. Grab a screenshot of your terminal, ensuring that its nicely cropped. Save this in your directory using `myNeuralNet.png` as the name.
    <br />Note: Make sure you have addded this screenshot since this screenshot will help us save time while verifying your work.

9. Open the file `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and add your name with your github URL.
   <br />Note: The format is `- [Your Name](https://github.com/yourgithubusername)`

11. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.

    - `git pull upstream main`

12. Commit and push the code to your fork.

13. Create a pull request to have the changes merged from your fork into the origin.

> Congratulations! You are now one pull request closer to getting that free t-shirt. Repeat these steps until you have made at least 4 qualifying pull requests. You can check how many qualifying pull requests you have made at <https://hacktoberfest.com/profile/> Have fun and Happy coding!
