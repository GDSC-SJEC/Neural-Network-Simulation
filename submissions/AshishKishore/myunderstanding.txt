Nueral Networks models after the nuerons in the biological brain. 
Each Neuron and edges have weights assinged to them and they adjust as the learning process proceeds.

In the code , we have formula which does the above mentioned.
The learning rate is the rate at which the weights adjusted to get the desired output.
And the initials weights are given.

With Epoch , corrections are made and finally we get the disired output.
